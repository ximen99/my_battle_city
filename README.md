# battle-city

remake of my childhood favourit game battle city with python3.7.4 and pygame 1.9.6

borrowed heavily from Raitis G's project. please check out his more complete version in the link below.

restructured the code so that it integrates better with the the classes in pygame package and the main game loop become more clearer (at least to me).
